# PyTorch-FedLearning
A Pytorch and Tenserflow federated learning framework for CNNs. Trains on decentralized image data, emphasizing privacy and security. Features include client dataset distribution, local training, gradient aggregation, and epoch-wise accuracy visualization.

There are two files avaliable for user to clone and our project allow for customized dataset.
- Pytorch-federated.py
- tensorflow-federated.py

We ends up 97% accuracy in our customize dataset generated from our other repository.
[Notice]: main.py 即將被刪出，因為模型準確率不好。
